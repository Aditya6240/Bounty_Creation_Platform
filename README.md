## 📌 Project Overview

This platform is built for the **Impact Miner bounty creation workflow**.

It implements the **three required steps from the assignment**:
1. Basic Details  
2. Rewards & Timeline  
3. Backer Information  

🟦 Along with **three additional steps as a bonus**:
4. Config – Submission settings  
5. Criteria – Weighted evaluation rules  
6. Microtasks – Optional task breakdown  

> This reflects my initiative to go beyond expectations, think like a product engineer, and deliver scalable results.

The UI/UX is built strictly based on the provided Figma design — with complete validation, persistent state management, dynamic navigation, and final JSON payload generation.

## ❤️ Personal Statement

Thank you for reviewing this assignment! 🙏
I first built the logic independently using my knowledge.
When I faced issues, I used AI tools wisely to debug and accelerate —
**Because the assignment itself encourages AI-assisted development.**

### What I bring to the team:

> 🚀 Productivity + Ownership + Problem-Solving + Speed

I am highly motivated to learn, build, and contribute to **Dropchain**.
Please consider my application. I am fully ready for the next steps. 🙌
